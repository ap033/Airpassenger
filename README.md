Build a Model to forecast the demand (passenger traffic) in Airplanes. The
data is classified in data /time and the passengers travelling per month.
We have a problem statement with ia a line which has the data of
passengers across months so here what you need to do you need to build a
forecast to determine how many number of passengers are going to abort
these Airlines at the month level in the future so here we have month or you
can say dates so here we have dates from 1949 till 1960 and we have the
number of passengers traveling per month so now we have this kind of
data and we need to analyze what will be the number of passengers if you
have to predict it for next 10 years so now let me just go to jupiter notebook
and it is how prediction look like :
